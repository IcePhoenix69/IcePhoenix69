## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a new FSD (Full Stack Developer) from Refresh Academy.
For six long month, since 27/01/2025 to 25/07/2025, i'm learning how to be a Web developer for Front-End and Back-End projects.
Most of my project are not done in this repo, because i had to work with my teams, but i want to publish them here (when i have time).

My current known programming/markup languages are:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JS
 - Node.js
 - Express.JS
 - React.js
 - SQL + SQLite

I want to learn properly for myself and for my portfolio:
 - C++
 - C# (because i want to understand some memes)
 - Python
 - Java
 - PHP
 - Any good alternative to HTML (like HTMX, internet have a good opinion on this)
 - Next.js
