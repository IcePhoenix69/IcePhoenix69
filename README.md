# Hello there 👋

I am Matteo Ventura, a guy on the Internet with a GitHub Account. See my info below.

## About myself
I'm a new FSD (Full Stack Developer) from [Refresh Academy](https://refresh-academy.org/).  
For six long month, since 27/01/2025 to 25/07/2025, i had learned how to be a Web Developer for Front-End and Back-End projects (aka Full Stack Developer).  
Most of my projects are not in this account, because i had to work with my teams, but i want to publish them here (when i will have some free time).

My hobbies are: Cooking, Cat (i have a cat), Playing Videogames (don't have the time right now), Magic the Gathering (only paper), Dungeon and Dragons, and sometimes Gardening (i want to make a herb/spices garden).

I like cooking, i feel good when cooking, and i try some recipes online, some seen on tv (see Masterchef regularly).  
 I prefer Italian (because we are the best at cooking) and Asiatic (mostly japanese and malasyan) cuisine.  
Recently i started playing Magic the Gathering, and to me is an addiction, but i don't buy cards, i just love the artworks and the fact that it can be used to learn some programming logic, it's impressive.

### Journal zone

Update of 15/10/2025 (EU format): Right now i started an apprenticeship at Cineca, a company in Italy, for 6 month, and i'm very happy.
Except the fact that i need to learn Java, Angular, TypeScript, SpringBoot, GraphQL and RestAPI in a month. I will have nightmares about it.

Update of 20/11/2025 (EU format): I have made a simple project to learn Java SpringBoot and use it instead of Express.js, then MongoDB connected with Docker.
For me it's a better way to manage a DB, and it's easier than SQL, but Docker itself is a little confusing. I need more practice to use it efficiently.

Update of 16/02/2026 (EU format): So, i started working hard to learn properly the company policy, known my colleagues, Spring Boot, Podman instead of Docker (for licence purposes).
I'm tired, but right now i can start my own projects, except for the fact that i work 8 hours a day with 4 hours of travelling everyday, but i can try.  
As for work, i started testing the company services, and i won't talk about it here (company policies), but i started using Junit 5 and Mockito to create test suites.
Work is good, and i actually like the workplace, but the timing of the request and projects is too unstable for my liking (eh, i'm a peculiar man).

My current known programming/markup languages are:
 - HTML (good)
 - CSS (good)
 - JS (very good)
 - Node.js (ok)
 - Express.js (ok)
 - React.js (ok)
 - SQL + SQLite (not-so-good)
 - Java (good)

In-learning programming languages:
 - [x] Java (to be better)
 - [x] SpringBoot (good) (yes i know it's a framework)
 - [x] Angular (yes i know it's a framework)
 - [x] TypeScript
 - [x] MongoDB
 - [ ] GraphQL

Test framework:
 - [x] Mockito (for Spring)
 - [ ] Mocha (i don't like it but i used it in the past)
 - [ ] Cypress (not used but explored)

I want to learn properly for myself and for my portfolio:
 - [ ] C++ (people says it's good for making games, so why not)
 - [ ] Pixi.js (already seen, i'm curious)
 - [ ] C# (because i want to understand some memes)
 - [ ] Python
 - [ ] PHP
 - [ ] Any good alternative to HTML (like HTMX, internet have a good opinion on this)
 - [ ] Next.js
 - [ ] ADA (just for curiosity)
 - [ ] JavaFX (because it's a cool thing to use)
