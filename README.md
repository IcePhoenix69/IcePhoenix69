## Hello there 👋

### About myself
I'm a new FSD (Full Stack Developer) from Refresh Academy.
For six long month, since 27/01/2025 to 25/07/2025, i'm learning how to be a Web developer for Front-End and Back-End projects.
Most of my project are not done in this repo, because i had to work with my teams, but i want to publish them here (when i have time).

Update of 15/10/2025 (EU format): Right now i started an apprenticeship at Cineca, a business in Italy, and i'm very happy.
Except the fact tat i neel to learn Java, Angular, TypeScript, GraphQL and RestAPI in a month. I will have nightmares about it.

My current known programming/markup languages are:
 - HTML (good)
 - CSS (good)
 - JS (very good)
 - Node.js (ok)
 - Express.JS (ok)
 - React.js (ok)
 - SQL + SQLite (not-so-good)

In-learning programming languages:
 - [x] Java
 - [ ] Angular
 - [ ] GraphQL

I want to learn properly for myself and for my portfolio:
 - [ ] C++
 - [ ] C# (because i want to understand some memes)
 - [ ] Python
 - [ ] PHP
 - [ ] Any good alternative to HTML (like HTMX, internet have a good opinion on this)
 - [ ] Next.js
 - [ ] ADA (just for curiosity)
